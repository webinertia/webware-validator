# webware/skeleton

Greenfield starter for Webware packages: the shared tooling config, the organization's
required CI workflow contract, and a containerized dev environment — so a new component
starts aligned instead of being retrofitted.

> **The badges are fenced deliberately.** Un-fence the block below, replace every

> Nothing should advertise a workflow, a package or a report that does not exist yet.

Placeholders: `OWNER/PACKAGE` is the Packagist name, `ORG/REPO` the GitHub
coordinates, `DEFAULT_BRANCH` the default branch.

## What ships here

Everything in this repository is either a **package of record** consumed from
`webware/webware-tools`, or the **thin per-repo wiring** that cannot live in a shared
config:

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `mago.toml` | Extends the centre (`vendor/webware/webware-tools/mago.toml`) and overrides `php-version` only. Never re-add general rules locally. |
| `webware-ci.json` | The required CI workflow's parameter contract — read from the repository root by `webinertia/.github`. |
| `phpunit.xml.dist` | PHPUnit 13 strict mode: `requireCoverageMetadata`, `failOnNotice`, `failOnWarning`, `failOnDeprecation`. |
| `compose.yml` / `Dockerfile` / `.devcontainer/` | The containerized toolchain (Composer, PHPUnit, Mago, Infection, PHPBench, roave BC-check). |
| `src/ConfigProvider.php` | The package wiring entry point, declared under `extra.laminas.config-provider`. |

`mago.toml`, `phpunit.xml.dist`, `.gitattributes`, `codecov.yml`, `Dockerfile`,
`.dockerignore`, `infection.json5.dist`, `phpbench.json.dist` and devcontainer config are
byte-identical to the canonical artifacts in
`webware-tools/presets/webware-alignment/artifacts/` — copy updates from there rather than
editing them here.

## Using this template

Work the list top to bottom; the namespace rename is the one that bites, because
`extra.laminas.config-provider` is a plain string that no tool validates for you.

- [ ] `composer.json` — `name`, `description`, `keywords`
- [ ] `composer.json` — `extra.laminas.config-provider` → the new FQCN
- [ ] `composer.json` — both PSR-4 roots: `Webware\Skeleton\` → `src/` and the two `WebwareTest*` roots
- [ ] `src/`, `test/unit/`, `test/integration/` — namespaces and `use` statements
- [ ] Every new file's header block — "This file is part of the Webware Skeleton package"
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — the title line
- [ ] `README.md` — this title, the description, and the fenced badge block (un-fence it, replace the placeholders)
- [ ] `LICENSE` — copyright holder and year
- [ ] `webware-ci.json` — `min_msi` / `min_covered_msi` (see below), and uncomment the `db_*` keys for a package whose tests need a database
- [ ] Default branch — a new repo starts on an `N.N.x` branch (this one is `1.0.x`)

The full badge block sits at the top of this file, fenced. Un-fence it and replace the
`OWNER/PACKAGE`, `ORG/REPO` and `DEFAULT_BRANCH` placeholders there rather than adding a
second copy here.

The Stryker badge embeds the branch segment — update it in both the badge URL and the
dashboard link whenever the default branch changes.

**Do not point the CI badge at `continuous-integration.yml`.** A consumer repository has no
such file, so that URL 404s. The required-route URL above is the one GitHub's own "Create
status badge" dialog produces, because the workflow file lives in the config repository.

## Quality gates

Both MSI gates are set to **95** — the ecosystem standard, not a starting point. Lower them
only with a deliberate decision, and never silently:

```json
"min_msi": "95",
"min_covered_msi": "95"
```

Four Mago gates run in CI and must be clean: `format --check`, `lint`, `analyze`, `guard`.
Run `mago fmt` first when making changes, and fix findings at source rather than adding
`@mago-expect` — a suppression needs to be a decision, not a reflex.

## Development

The toolchain runs in a container, so the host needs no PHP install. With VS Code, reopen in
the container; without it:

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec tooling composer install
docker compose exec tooling composer test
docker compose exec tooling composer test-integration
docker compose exec tooling mago lint
docker compose down
```

Packages whose tests need MySQL uncomment the `mysql` service in `compose.yml`, mirroring the
`db_image` / `db_env_json` / `db_port` values they declare in `webware-ci.json`.
